I have strong opinions on the way that coding is taught in college, but it all boils down to this:

**It's hard to learn coding in college, because it's terrible to try to learn to code over a 14-week period**

Basically, learning to code means learning a bunch of different concepts that all interconnect, and the fact that college only teaches you a concept every week or two means that by the time you learn one thing, you've forgotten a lot of the others.

So the advice I give to anyone who is trying to learn to code is twofold:
  1. Use Youtube and Google for the actual learning part
  2. Use college only as a way to get certified (your degree) and to get feedback (professors and classmates).

If you can, I think it's easier to just learn coding outside of your class. For example, here's a one-hour-long tutorial:

{{< youtube kqtD5dpn9C8 >}}

Some things about this video:
It's free
It's well-paced and entertaining
It's interactive (i.e. it teaches a principle, then asks you to pause and practice)
It covers just about everything in CSE110 and CSE111 in an hour, as opposed to stretching it out over 6 months.

And I think that last point is the key.

The college model works like this:

LEARN ONE PRINCIPLE :point_right: PRACTICE ONE PRINCIPLE [week passes] LEARN NEW PRINCIPLE :point_right: PRACTICE NEW PRINCIPLE

While the self-teaching from the internet model works like this:
LEARN ALL THE BASIC PRINCIPLES AT ONCE :point_right: PRACTICE USING THEM OVER AND OVER, IN HARMONY

So what I do before taking a course is look on YouTube for a good tutorial. I spend a few hours taking the tutorial, and BOOM, now I know all of the basic principles for that programming language.
Then for the rest of the semester, I'm just practicing and reviewing and internalizing the basics that I learned on day one.

Here's a 50-second video that sums up another good principle:

{{< youtube nvlizC6koSc >}}

The important principle there is that it's a lot easier to learn to code if you're trying to build something meaningful. So it can help to focus your coding journey around your own projects. Again, the internet is really helpful here. There are all sorts of websites and YouTube videos that will give you good beginner projects, in whatever language you want.

I could go on, but this is a lot of text and I'm not sure how well I've addressed your central question about learning concepts. So let me know if you have questions about a specific set of concepts -- I know what it's like to feel like you're reading gibberish when you're trying to parse through a tutorial.
